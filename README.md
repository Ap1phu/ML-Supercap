In this Github repository, we have provided further information about our research work titled "Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the “Synergistic” Pseudocapacitive Effects of Heteroatom doped Graphene" (DOI:....). The repository includes the following.
- the collected experimental data in a csv file format
- the code used to preprocess + train ANN model
- the trained model that was further used to draw scientific insights
- the code for contour plot visualization to help locate the optimal point for interested researchers
