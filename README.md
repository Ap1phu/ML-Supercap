In this Github repository, we have provided further information about our research work titled "Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the “Synergistic” Pseudocapacitive Effects of Heteroatom doped Graphene" (DOI:....). The repository includes the following.
- the code used to preprocess + train ANN model
- the code for contour plot visualization
Some contents regarding the trained model that will be posted later after the paper is published including
- the collected experimental data in a csv file format 
- the trained model that was further used to draw scientific insights
